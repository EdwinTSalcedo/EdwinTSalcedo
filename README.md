# Hey there! 👋 

I'm a Systems Engineer from Bolivia who's into IoT, Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Research. 

Currently I'm a lecturer and researcher **[@UCB](https://www.ucb.edu.bo/)** building and scaling machine learning algorithms to the cloud using technologies like, AWS, Kubernetes + Docker, and MeanJS to serve our infrastructure platform! I also focus on building ML algorithms to specifically search for anomalies within sensor data.
